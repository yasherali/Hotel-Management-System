# Hotel-Management-System
Welcome to the repository for our Hotel Management System! This is a comprehensive web application designed to help hotel managers and staff manage all aspects of their operations, including room bookings, guest check-ins and check-outs, food management, billing management and more.

This application is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. We've utilized the latest web development technologies and best practices to create a fast, responsive, and user-friendly interface for hotel staff and guests alike.

Some of the key features of this system include:

- Room availability and reservation management
- Guest check-in and check-out
- Food management 
- Billing and payment processing
- Admin portal

We've designed this application to be easily customizable and extensible, so you can tailor it to your hotel's specific needs. Whether you're running a small boutique hotel or a large chain, our Hotel Management System can help streamline your operations and improve the guest experience.

We welcome contributions from the community and are committed to keeping this project up to date with the latest web technologies and best practices. Feel free to explore the code, report any issues you find, and submit pull requests with your own improvements and bug fixes.

Thank you for your interest in our Hotel Management System!
